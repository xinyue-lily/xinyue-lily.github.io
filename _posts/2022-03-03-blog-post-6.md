# Fake News Classification

## The Task
We will develop and assess a fake news classifier using Tensorflow.

This is the link to my github respository. [https://github.com/xinyudong1129/Blog-Post/tree/main/blogpost6](https://github.com/xinyudong1129/Blog-Post/tree/main/blogpost6)

[Stop Words](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29523254/python-remove-stop-words-from-pandas-dataframe)



## 1. Obtain Data

### (1) DataSource

Our data comes from the article
- Ahmed H, Traore I, Saad S.(2017)"Detection of Online Fake News Using N-Gram Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques. In: Traore I., Woungang I., Awad A.(eds) *Intelligent, Secure,and Dependable Systems in Distributed and Cloud Environments.* ISDDC 2017. *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*, vol 10618. Springer, Cham (pp.127-138)

- The professor have done a small amount of data cleaning and performed a train-test split.

### (2) Make a Dataset
We wrote a function called make_dataset. This function does two things:

- Remove stopwords from the article text and title . A stopword is a word that is usually considered to be uninformative, such as “the,” “and,” or “but.” 

- Construct and return a tf.data.Dataset with two inputs and one output. The input are (title, text) , and the output consist only of the fake column. 

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop = stopwords.words('english')
def make_dataset(df):
    df["title"] = df["title"].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in 
                                    x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
    df["text"] = df["text"].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in 
                                  x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
    data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    (
        {
            "title" : df[["title"]],
            "text" : df[["text"]]
        }, 
        {
            "fake" : df[["fake"]]
        }
       )
    )
    return data
```

### (3) Perform train/test/vaidation split
Call the function make_dataset on my training dataframe to produce a train_dataset, then split 20% of it to use for validation_dataset. 

Call the function make_dataset on my testing dataframe to produce a test_dataset.

For each of the three Datasets, we batch them into small chunks of data. This can sometimes reduce accuracy, but can also greatly increase the speed of training. I found batches of 100 rows to work well.

```python
df1 = pd.read_csv("fake_news_train.csv")
data = make_dataset(df1)
data = data.shuffle(buffer_size = len(data))
train_size = int(0.8*len(data))
train_dataset = data.take(train_size).batch(100)
val_dataset = data.skip(train_size).batch(100)
df2 = pd.read_csv("fake_news_test.csv")
test_dataset = make_dataset(df2).batch(100)

len(train_dataset),len(val_dataset),len(test_dataset)
```
```python
(180, 45, 225)
```
### (4) Base Rate
The base rate refers to the accuracy of a model that always makes the same guess(for example, such a model might always say "fake news!"). Determine the base rate for this data set by examining the labels on the training set.
```python
df3 = df1[df1["fake"]==1]
base_rate =df3.shape[0]/df1.shape[0]
print(base_rate)
```
```python
0.522963160942581
```
## 2. Create Models

In this part, we create three Tensorflow models to compare their performance.

- In the first model, I use only the article title as an input.
- In the second model, I use only the article text as an input.
- In the third model, I use both the article title and the article text as input.

### (1) Standardization and Vectorization
*Standardization* refers to the act of taking a some text that's "messy" in some way and making it lesss messy. Common standardizations includes:
- Removing capitals.
- Removing punctuation.
- Removing HTML elements or other non-semantic content.

In this standardization, we convert all text to lowercase and remove punctuation.

```python
size_vocabulary = 2000

def standardization(input_data):
    lowercase = tf.strings.lower(input_data)
    no_punctuation = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercase,
                        '[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation),'')
    return no_punctuation 
```
*Vectorization* refers to the process of representing text as a vector (array, tensor). There are multiple ways to carry out vectorization. We replace each word by its *frequency rank* in the data. 

```python
vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(
    standardize=standardization,
    max_tokens=size_vocabulary, # only consider this many words
    output_mode='int',
    output_sequence_length=500) 
vectorize_layer.adapt(train_dataset.map(lambda x, y: x["title"]))
vectorize_layer.adapt(train_dataset.map(lambda x, y: x["text"]))
```

We adapt the vectorizaiton layer to the title and the text. In the adaption process, the vectorization layer learns what words are common in title and text.

```python
embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(size_vocabulary, output_dim = 10, 
                                   name = "embedding")
```
We created an embedding layer in 10 dimensions.
### (2) Inputs
Specify the two kinds of Keras.Input for our model. We have one input for each qualitatively distinct kind of predictor data.
```python
# inputs
title_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,), 
    name = "title",
    dtype = "string"
)

text_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,), 
    name = "text",
    dtype = "string"
)
```

### (3) Model1: only the article title as an input

In the first model, We wrote a pipeline for the title. This pipeline included one vectorize layer, one Embedding layer, one GlobalMaxPooling1D layer, one dense layer, two Dropout layer to reduce overfitting.

```python
# layers for processing the title
title_features = vectorize_layer(title_input)
title_features = embedding_layer(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.3)(title_features)
title_features = layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D()(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.3)(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dense(32, activation='sigmoid')(title_features)
title_output = layers.Dense(2,name="fake")(title_features)
model1 = keras.Model(
    inputs = [title_input], 
    outputs = title_output
)
```
Train model1 and plot the history of the accuracy on both the training and vailidation sets.

```python
model1.compile(optimizer = "adam",
            loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
            metrics=['accuracy']
)
history = model1.fit(train_dataset, 
                validation_data=val_dataset,
                epochs = 10) 
```
Here's the history of the accuracy on both the training and vailidation sets.

#### My observations
- The validation accuracy of model1 stabilized between **89% and 94.7%** during training.

- The highest validation accuracy is **94.61%**. 

- From the plot, I observed overfitting in model1. 


### (4) Model2: Only the article text as an input

We wrote a pipeline for the text. This pipeline included one vectorize layer, one Embedding layer, one GlobalMaxPooling1D layer, one dense layer, two Dropout layer. The pipeline is pretty much the same as model1 to compare their performance.

```python
text_features = vectorize_layer(text_input)
text_features = embedding_layer(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.3)(text_features)
text_features = layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D()(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.3)(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dense(32, activation='sigmoid')(text_features)
text_output = layers.Dense(2,name="fake")(text_features)
model2 = keras.Model(
    inputs = [text_input], 
    outputs = text_output
)
```
Train model2 and plot the history of the accuracy on both the training and vailidation sets.

```python
model2.compile(optimizer = "adam",
              loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy']
)
history = model2.fit(train_dataset, 
                    validation_data=val_dataset,

```
![model2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinyue-lily/xinyue-lily.github.io/master/images/model2.png)

#### My observations
- The validation accuracy of model2 stabilized between **77% and 92%** during training.

- The highest validation accuracy is **92.09%**, a little lower than model1.

- From the plot, overfitting is not observed in model2. 


### (5) Model3: both the article title and the article text as input

We concatenate the output of the title pipeline with the output of the text pipeline, then pass the consolidated set of computed features through a Dense layer.

```python
main = layers.concatenate([title_features,text_features],axis=1)
output = layers.Dense(2)(main)
model3 = keras.Model(
     inputs = [title_input,text_input],
     outputs = output
)
```
We have created the model3 and we can visualize the model plot using the plot_model function.

```python
keras.utils.plot_model(model3)
```
![model3-structure.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinyue-lily/xinyue-lily.github.io/master/images/model3-structure.png)

```python
model3.compile(optimizer = "adam",
              loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy']
)
history = model3.fit(train_dataset, 
                    validation_data=val_dataset,
                    epochs = 10)

Plot the history of model3, including the training and validation performance.

```python
plt.plot(history.history["accuracy"], label = "training")
plt.plot(history.history["val_accuracy"], label = "validation")
plt.gca().set(xlabel = "epoch", ylabel = "accuracy")
plt.legend()
```
![model3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinyue-lily/xinyue-lily.github.io/master/images/model3.png)

#### My observations
- The validation accuracy of model3 stabilized between **97.64% and 98.15%** during training.

- The highest validation accuracy is **98.15%**. 

- From the plot, I observed overfitting in model3.

- **The performance of model3 has significant improvement over model1 and model2. It's proved that both the article title and the article text as input is much better than single one as input.**

## 3.Model Evaluation
We’ll test the model performance on unseen test data. 

```python
model3.evaluate(test_dataset)
```
```python
225/225 [==============================] - 3s 11ms/step - loss: 0.0670
                                         - accuracy: 0.9775
```
```python
[0.06704675406217575, 0.977504551410675]
```
The accuracy of test_dataset is **97.75%**, not bad!


## 4.Embedding Visualizaiton
*Word Embedding* refers to a representation of a word in a vector space. Each word is assigned an individual vector. The general aim of a word embedding is to create a representation such that word with related meanings are close to each other in a vector space, while words with different meanings are farther apart.

It's fun to take a look at the embedding learned by our model, We are able to find some interesting relations in the words that the model found useful when distinguishing real news from fake news.

We choose to create a 10-dimensional embedding when constructing our model. For plotting in 2 dimensions, we select principal component analysis (PCA) and then make a data frame for our results.

```python
# get the weights from the embedding layer
weights = model3.get_layer('embedding').get_weights()[0] 
# get the vocabulary from our data prep for later
vocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()  

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
weights = pca.fit_transform(weights)

embedding_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'word' : vocab, 
    'x0'   : weights[:,0],
    'x1'   : weights[:,1]
})
```
Now we're Ready to plot! Note that the embedding appear to be “stretched out” in two directions, with one direction corresponding to fake news or not.

```python
import plotly.express as px 
fig = px.scatter(embedding_df, 
                 x = "x0", 
                 y = "x1", 
                 size = list(np.ones(len(embedding_df))),
                 size_max = 2,
                 hover_name = "word")

fig.show()
```

{% include embedding.html %}

We have made a word embedding which seems to have learned some reasonable associations.

With these considerations in mind, let’s see what kinds of words our model associates with Trump and Putin.

```python
f = ["Trump"]
m = ["Putin"]

highlight_1 = ["oil", "voting","fail","nuclear"]
highlight_2 = ["fight", "Russia", "Korea"]

def gender_mapper(x):
    if x in f:
        return 1
    elif x in m:
        return 4
    elif x in highlight_1:
        return 3
    elif x in highlight_2:
        return 2
    else:
        return 0

embedding_df["highlight"] = embedding_df["word"].apply(gender_mapper)
embedding_df["size"]      = np.array(1.0 + 50*(embedding_df["highlight"] > 0))
```
```python
import plotly.express as px 

fig = px.scatter(embedding_df, 
                 x = "x0", 
                 y = "x1", 
                 color = "highlight",
                 size = list(embedding_df["size"]),
                 size_max = 10,
                 hover_name = "word")

fig.show()
```
{% include wordsembedding.html %}

#### My observations:
- The words like "oil", "voting" and "fail" are more closely located to Trump.
- The words like "nuclear", "Russia" and "Korea" are more closely located to Putin.
- Trump and Putin are close because they mentioned each other for many times.


Thank you!!!
