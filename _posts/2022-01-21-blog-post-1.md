## 1. Create a Database

> First, We import the packages we need, then create a database called temp.db with three tables: temperatures , stations , and countries.

```python
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
from plotly.io import write_html
import pandas as pd
```

```python
#create a database in current directory called temps.db
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") 
#We clean up the data using the function prepare_df
def prepare_df(df):
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    #stack up everything except for the indexes chosen so that 
    #the months fall in a single column
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    #rename the columns
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    #keep only the last two characters in the column "Months" so 
    #that we can turn a word into numbers
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    #turn the data in "Temp" into degrees
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```
<br />
Load data from temps.csv, countries.csv, and station-metadata.csv and clean up our data.

```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)

countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"Name"  : "Country" })
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
stations["FIPS 10-4"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2]
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Every thing looks right.

## 2. Write a Query Function

> We need to left join particular datasets so that our seperate tables can be joined as one using SQL.

```python

def query_climate_database(country,year_begin,year_end,month):
    '''
    The function accepts four arguments:country: a string giving the 
    name of a country for which data should be returned. year_begin 
    and year_end: two integers giving the earliest and latest years
    for which should be returned. month: an integer giving the month 
    of the year for which should be returned. 
    The return value is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for 
    the specied country, in the specied date range, in the specied month 
    of the year. 
    '''

    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.Country,T.year,T.month,T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON S."FIPS 10-4"= C."FIPS 10-4"
    where C.Country ='%s' and month = '%d' and year>='%d' and year<='%d'
    """%( country,month ,year_begin,year_end)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    return df
```
<br />
We got the temperature data of all stations in India in Junuary from 1980 to 2020 .

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #connect temps.db
query_climate_database(country="India",year_begin=1980,year_end=2020,month=1)
```

{% include Table1.html %}


## 3. Write a Geographical Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

> We use plotly to create an interesting geographic plot.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    
    '''
    compute the first coeffient of a linear regression model at 
    that station
    '''
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # x should be a DataFrame
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return round(LR.coef_[0],5)

#we create a dictionary including all of the months
arr1={1:"January",2:"Feburary",3:"March",4:"April",5:"May",6:"June",7:"July",
      8:"August",9:"September",10:"October",11:"November",12:"December"}

# calculate the yearly increase in temperature.
def termperature_coefficient_plot(country,year_begin,year_end,month,min_obs,**kwargs):
    '''

    The function shows an interactive geographic scatterplot, constructed
    using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that the color
    of the point reects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature 
    during the specied month and time period at that station. 

    '''
    df = query_climate_database(country=country,year_begin=year_begin,
                                year_end=year_end,month=month)
    
    #calculate number of years of data for any given station
    df["len"]= df.groupby(["NAME","Month"])["Temp"].transform(len) 

    #remove those stations whose number of years is smaller than min_obs.
    climate = df[df["len"]>= min_obs]
    coefs = climate.groupby(["NAME", "Month"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()

    #merge the data 
    climate = pd.merge(climate, coefs, on = ["NAME"]).dropna()
    climate = climate.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase(%C)"})
    
    #use plotly to generate an interactive plot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(climate, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        color = "Estimated Yearly Increase(%C)",
                        opacity = 0.2,
                        height = 300,
                        **kwargs
                        )
    
    #generate the title of the plot
    s1 = "Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {0} for stations 
          in {1} years {2}-{3}"
    s = s1.format(arr1[month],country,str(year_begin),str(year_end))
    fig.update_layout(title=s)
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return fig
```    
<br />
We create a plot of estimated yearly increases in temperature during the month of January, in the interval 1980-2020, in India.

```python   

color_map = px.colors.cyclical.IceFire
fig = termperature_coefficient_plot(country="India",
                                    year_begin=1980,
                                    year_end=2020,
                                    month=1,
                                    min_obs=10,
                                    zoom=2,
                                    mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                    color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                                    color_continuous_scale=color_map
                                  )
fig.show()
conn.close()
```

{% include temperature_coefficient_plot.html %}

## 4. Create Two More Interesting Figures

### (1)Monthly Changes in Temperature in Different Stations of a country

```python
def LinePicture(country, start_year,end_year):
    '''
    This function shows multiple facets. The function have three
    arguments. This function is to plot several different
    figures which can represent how temperature changed by month
    from start_year to end_year. 
    '''
    
    # write our CMD to extract data.
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp,C.Country
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON S."FIPS 10-4"= C."FIPS 10-4"
    WHERE C.Country = ? and (T.year between ? and ?)
    order by T.year
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (country, start_year,end_year))
    
    # plot our data.
    fig = px.line(data_frame = df, 
                  x = "Month", 
                  y = "Temp",
                  color = "NAME",
                  facet_col = "Year",
                  title = "Monthly Changes in Temperature in different Years and different stations in "+country 
                )
    # show the plot
    return fig
```

<br />
We create a multiple-facets plot of monthly changes in temperature of different stations in India from 2000 to 2003.

```python
fig = LinePicture("India",2000,2003)
write_html(fig, "LinePicture.html")
fig.show()

```

{% include LinePicture.html %}

<br />
From the plot, we can clearly see that the basic pattern of each station remains the same, regardless of change in years.



### (2) The Changes of Temperature in differnet months around the world

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/
                    master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)
def AvgTemp(year,month1,month2):
    '''
    This function shows multiple facets. The function have three
    arguments. This function plots two different figures which 
    represents how temperature changed between Month1 and Month2. 
    '''
    
    # write our CMD to extract data.
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT C.Country,month,Avg(temp)
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON S."FIPS 10-4"= C."FIPS 10-4"
    where T.year = ? and T.month = ? or T.Month = ? 
    group by C.Country,month
    """
       
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn,params=(year,month1,month2))
      
    fig = px.choropleth(df, 
                    geojson=countries_gj,
                    locations = "Country",
                    locationmode = "country names",
                    color = "Avg(temp)", 
                    height = 350,
                    facet_col = "Month",
                    title = "Changes in Temperature January and July of "+str(year)
                    )

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```    

<br />
We draw a plot that shows the changes of temperature in January and July of 2000 all around the world.

```python
fig = AvgTemp(2000,1,7)
fig.show()
conn.close()
```

{% include AvgTemp.html %}

<br />
From the plot, I found that our plot makes basic sense, since the temperature in Janurary is a lot colder than that in July. We can see that the graph is a lot "oranger" in July and a lot more "purple" in Janurary. We can also see the degree of changes in different areas between the two months.
