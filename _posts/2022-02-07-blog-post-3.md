# Web Scraping

## 1. My Favorite Movie

> My favorite movie series is Harry Potter, the story of the wizarding world. In this blog I am going to scrape the data containing the information of the actors and display the results. Here is the [start](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/).

## 2. Web scrapying with crawl

> This is the link to my github respository. [https://github.com/xinyudong1129/Blog-Post/tree/main/blogpost3](https://github.com/xinyudong1129/Blog-Post/tree/main/blogpost3)

(1)First, We start from the IMDB page of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*

```python
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
   
    name = "imdb_spider"
       
    start_urls = [
        "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/"    
    ]

    def parse_start_url(self,response):
        return self.parse(response)

```

(2)Secondly, We located the starting IMDB page and then navigated to the *Cast & Crew* page.

```python
def parse(self,response):
    '''
    This function help us to read the data from starting IMDB page, then
    navigate to the Full Cast & Crew page. Once there, the parse_full_credits
    (self,response) will be called.
    '''
    url= response.url + "fullcredits/"
    yield Request(url,callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

(3)Thirdly, we write a function called parse_full_credits () to scrape all the actor names and go to their IMDB pages.

```python
def parse_full_credits(self,response):
    '''
    Assume that we start on the Cast & Crew page, the function yield a 
    scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page. when 
    actor's page is reached, the yield request mothod parse_actor_page
    (self,response) will be called.
    '''
    links = response.css("td.primary_photo").css("a")
    actorname = [link.attrib["href"] for link in links]
    for i in actorname:
        url ="https://www.imdb.com/"+ i
        yield Request(url,callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

(4)Then, We write a function parse_actor_page(), which scrapes the actor/actress's Filmography section and log all the movies or TV shows that he/she has worked on.

```python
def parse_actor_page(self,response):
    '''
    Assume that we start on the page of an actor/actress, the function 
    yield a dictionary for each of the movies or TV shows on which that
    actor/actress has worked.
    '''
    actor = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()
    boxes = response.css("div#content-2-wide.redesign")
    Movie = boxes.css('div.filmo-row[id^="actor"]').css('b').css('a::text')
            .extract()
                
    for m in Movie:
        yield{
            "actor":actor,
            "Movie_or_TV_name":m
        }

```

(5) Finally, the command
```python 
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o result.csv 
```
will run our spider and save a csv file called result.csv, with columns for actor names and the movie and TV shows on which they worked.

## 3. Recommendation
After we got the result.csv which storded the actor names and the movie and TV shows they worked, we can compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with my favorited movie or TV shows.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("result.csv")
df1 = df.groupby("Movie_or_TV_name").size().reset_index
    (name="Number of shared actors")
sorted = df1.sort_values(by="Number of shared actors",ascending=False) 
sorted.index = list(range(0,int(df1.count()[0])))
sorted[0:50]
```
Here's the list I obtained for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

{% include sorted.html %}

> I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, maybe I like the harry potter series! It's resonable. The top three recommendation are Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
